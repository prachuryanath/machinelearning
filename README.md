# Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron (Book)
This book assumes that you know close to nothing about Machine Learning. Its goal is to give you the concepts, tools, and intuition you need to implement programs capable of learning from data. We will cover a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly used (such as linear regression) to some of the Deep Learning techniques that regularly win competitions.

Rather than implementing our own toy versions of each algorithm, we will be using production-ready Python frameworks:

Scikit-Learn is very easy to use, yet it implements many Machine Learning algorithms efficiently, so it makes for a great entry point to learn Machine Learning.
TensorFlow is a more complex library for distributed numerical computation. It makes it possible to train & run very large neural networks efficiently by distributing the computations across potentially hundreds of multi-GPU servers. TensorFlow was created at Google and supports many of its large-scale applications. It's been open source since Nov. 2015, with version 2.0 releasing Oct 2019.
Keras is a high-level Deep Learning API that makes it very simple to train and run neural networks. It can run on top of either TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly known as CNTK). TensorFlow comes with its own implementation of this API, called tf.keras, which provides support for some advanced TensorFlow features (e.g., the ability to efficiently load data).
